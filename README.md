# Data Wrangling in MySQL

Data wrangling is a process where the data is cleaned, normalized standardized and transformed to be ready for further analysis.

In this project we'll be using MySQL to wrangle the CAR SPECS data, which I found on Kaggle.
Putting into play skills like:
  - Identify and handle missing values
  - Handle inconsistent data
  - Grouping data (Binning)
  - Transforming columns and rows

This project helped me excercise my SQL skills such as:
  - Joins
  - Subquiries
  - Window functions
  - CTEs
